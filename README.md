## Interpretation and Basic Analysis of the Charts 




## Insights:
1.	 **Bikes** account for the majority of the total revenue (96.46%), while **Accessories** and **Clothing** contribute only marginally.
2.	Product colors show significant differences in revenue contribution: **black** and **red** **dominate** **but** recorded **declines in 2019**.
3.	Overall revenue grew strongly from 2016 to 2018 but plateaued in 2019, primarily due to a decline in sales growth of **Bikes in black and red** (This was the company's super-star product before).


## Recommendations:
1.	**Diversify the product portfolio**: Develop "Accessories" and "Clothing" categories to reduce reliance on "Bikes."
2.	**Analyze color demand**: Focus on trending colors like **yellow** and **blue** instead of over-relying on **black** and **red**.
3.	**Investigate the 2019 decline**: Conduct an in-depth analysis of causes and propose strategies for recovery in subsequent years.
